- # 👋 Hello, I’m Akwasi
- a curious thinker who is passionate about leveraging the power of data in creating competitive advantage. I have a dual masters degree in International Business and Business Analytics from Hult International Business school. This journey brought me to the universe
of GitHub to support my passion for data analytics and expand my knowledge.

Fun Fact : I love arts🖼️ and music🎵. You can also find me playing a soccer game or watching some of my favorite tv shows like Breaking Bad and Mad Men.
